# Token Staking Smart Contract

## Description

The Token Staking Smart Contract is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to stake their AptosCoin tokens and earn rewards over time. This contract provides a simple yet effective staking mechanism where users can lock their tokens for any duration and receive daily rewards based on their staked amount and staking period.

The contract features two core functions: `stake_tokens` for depositing tokens into the staking pool, and `unstake_tokens` for withdrawing staked tokens along with accumulated rewards. The reward system is designed with a 1% daily return rate, calculated based on the time tokens remain staked in the contract.

Key features include flexible staking amounts, partial unstaking capabilities, automatic reward calculation, and robust error handling to ensure secure transactions. The contract maintains individual staking records for each user, tracking their staked amounts, staking timestamps, and total rewards earned.

## Vision

Our vision is to democratize passive income generation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing a transparent, secure, and user-friendly staking platform. We aim to create an inclusive financial infrastructure where anyone can participate in token staking regardless of their technical expertise or the amount they wish to stake.

We envision a future where this staking contract serves as a foundational building block for a broader DeFi ecosystem on Aptos, fostering financial inclusion and empowering users to maximize the utility of their digital assets. By offering consistent and predictable returns, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional savings mechanisms and innovative blockchain-based financial products.
